# â™¿ Smart Gesture-Controlled Wheelchair Prototype
This project is a gesture-controlled wheelchair prototype developed with the help of friends, teachers, online resources (Google, YouTube, ChatGPT), and reference projects. The wheelchair can be operated using hand gestures and Bluetooth connectivity, allowing users to move it without traditional controls like joysticks.

Key features include:

Hand Gesture Control: Move your hand in specific directions to navigate the wheelchair.

Bluetooth Support: Control the wheelchair remotely via a smartphone or Bluetooth-enabled device.

Assistive Innovation: Aims to enhance independence for individuals with mobility challenges.

# ðŸ”§ Note: This is a self-learning project created by referencing existing solutions. While not fully original, we built and understood it from scratch.
